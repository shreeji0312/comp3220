### Introduction
We have made software in which the user will be able to find sufficient information form the
City of Windsor’s. We chose hospitals and school’s data sets to be displayed. Schools and
hospitals are an essential aspect of day to day life. It is most likely that a user searches the web
for information regarding schools or hospitals such as ls location or service availability. But the
main problem in our software is that the information we provided to the users is in.CSV format
because of this it may be difficult for users in some situations. We asked the user to enter
their or preferred locations X and Y coordinates. The software searches these coordinates in
data from .csv files and provides the user with essential information such as the location of the
nearest institutes.

### Problem Statement
Searching for some specific data from a large file can be difficult sometimes. Data for school in
the Windsor’s website have files with extension .csv and .kmz, it is harder to search anything
in these files. First, these files need to be downloaded and the user has to search the data bit
by bit to find the information they need. We have done our best to find a solution to this
problem by developing software that can be used in the easiest way possible. The user has to
enter the coordinates of a place they want to search and the software will provide the user with
the information of the nearest locations of schools and hospitals. But everything has positive
and negative aspects, in this case, we have also used the .csv file format. So the software may
take some time to provide the information. we think that is the only drawback of this software.
But it is certainly easier than the current open data source available in Windsor city’s website.

### Objective
Hospitals and schools are the most common and efficient resources that can be used by the
people of Windsor. We are given a project by the University of Windsor to analyze the one
data set which is the most important thing for the city and to determine which parts of the
open data could be different or better so to say. And what can we do to make it better and
easily accessible? The information is also non-copyrighted and free to use. Our project consists
of two types of information i.e., regarding schools and hospitals. So, users can find important
information regarding schools and hospitals. The tutorial file will also be given to the users so
there will be ease in working with the software.

### Motivation
Now a days the world is dependent on information, many cities around the world have already
started to move their data to an open data format. This is a motivation to the developers to
provide the public with specific resources. This is an opportunity for government to use that
data to answer the citizens’, researchers’, administrators’,business’ questions.

### Approach
Every project reaches its final step of development at some point. Our project is now in the
final stage. We have made many assumptions regarding this project. There were assumptions
regarding the data that will be displayed because in the future there will be many schools
and hospitals that will be added in the city. We also made many assumptions such as many
students will be added to many schools in the city, many patients will be discharged and many
of them might be admitted. There were also many assumptions regarding the number of users
that might use this software. We also thought about the type of users such as Doctors who will
be provided different information according to the field in which they are working while police
offices will be provided with different information. They will be given unique IDs according to
their field so that the common people might not get confidential information about the city’s
resources. We also created a working environment for java code to make the working software.
We also made many setups that were very useful while all the development. firstly, we gathered
many resources regarding this project and which was very helpful for us. We also took the data
sets that we used to show the user.

### Discussion
Now Discussing the project, there was a different behavior in the starting period of the devel-
opment. During phase one the prototype that we made was to read all types of files but when
we started the coding part, many bugs were stopping us from reading all types of files so, we
found a solution to remove the reading of all types of files. We then decided to read the .csv
files only and then the prototype worked as expected which allowed us to add more features
and solve all the bugs. Everything went according to plan because all the group members were
working together at the same time but there were days when all were not able to work together
so at that time we decided to keep the weekly target and which was the best part and all the
things went according to plan. The assumptions that we made for prototypes were very high
and it worked accordingly. The main benefit of this prototype is it is bug-free and provides
all important data set correctly so that people might not get any wrong information. It also
has many features as expected which will be helpful for local taxpayers to use.

### Scope
There is always going to be a need for information regarding schools and hospitals. So his
software has a better chance to be used by citizens of Windsor for a long term of time. This
software can be used by the government to provide citizens with efficient instructions and
information. This software can also be used to store important data. We think that the
software has a better scope in the future. 

### Conclusion
The objective of the project was to provide the open data sets to local taxpayers of Windsor.
We learned many things doing this project. We learned about how to teamwork, we also learned
about the development cycle. we made many assumptions and many expectations. The project
that we made exceeds those expectations. In this project, there were some difficulties in the
beginning, but we have overcome those difficulties through teamwork. We have gained a great
experience or insight so to say of working in a school or a hospital. This project presents a
real-world situation. To generate this final project report everything had to be precise. We had
to follow data designing properly. Our teamwork ability has developed throughout this whole
project. We have developed self-esteem in handling real-life projects.
